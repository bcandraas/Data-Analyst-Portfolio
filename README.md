# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
 
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under RevoU Full-Stack-Data Analytics course.

RevoU online data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in SQL, Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and Tableau as I build a portfolio of projects.

Tools for this projects are SQL (Google BigQuery), Python (Google Colab), Tableau and Google Data Studio
