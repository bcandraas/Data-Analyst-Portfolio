Custoemer segmentation is the process of separating the customers into groups based on certain traits. This process also makes it easy to tailor and personalize marketing, service and sales efforts to the needs of specific groups.

## Background or Expert Problem

Marketing team wants to know more about their customer characteristics to personalize the approach and define the marketing strategies better.

We found only 40% of total user who finished all sessions and made transaction.

Therefore, to tackle that problem, we focus on boosting user loyalty and conversion rate.

## Methodology
 1. Project preparation and project scoping 
 2. Business problem and discovering datasets, data collection
 3. Data cleaning and validation
 4. Exploratory data analysis and cluster analysis
 5. Collects, integrates and analysis all relevant data and information
 6. Draw logical and objectives conclusion
 7. Identifies a number of solutions
 8. Priorities Solutions

## Clustering
The variables that needs to be focused:

1. Recency: How long since last using the app (days)

2. Frequency: How many times user use the application

3. Monetary: The average amount spend of user

Based on the variables, the customers divided into 3 groups; Rocket, Satellite and Astro-Planet

## Recommendation

We focus on astro-planet cluster because this cluster has the lowest convertion rate even though their monetary is the highest compare to other clusters.
